1	one time, I find the output of checher have two redundent **
finally I find that there miss a default rule in tableSC start condition in very.lpp, 
and I miss spell the rule for "*",
while a miss rule's default action is to print it out,
so It just print the two * in table endtable out to cout.
I add the rule for "*" , and add a default rule to signal a fail for future problems
